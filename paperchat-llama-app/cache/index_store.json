The best\r\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\r\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,\r\nbased solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\r\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\r\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\r\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\r\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\r\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\r\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after\r\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\r\nbest models from the literature. 1    Introduction\r\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [12] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks\r\nin particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\r\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [29,2,5].

Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\r\nstatesht, as a function of the previous hidden stateht\u00001and the input for positiont. This inherently\r\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\r\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\r\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional\r\ncomputation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\r\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains. Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\r\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\r\nthe input or output sequences [2,16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\r\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network. In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\r\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\r\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. 2    Background\r\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\r\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\r\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\r\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\r\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\r\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [11]. In the Transformer this is\r\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\r\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\r\ndescribed in section 3.2. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\r\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"e206d1b6-73bd-4693-a4c4-bd64c265537d":{"id_":"e206d1b6-73bd-4693-a4c4-bd64c265537d","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"pzM80800mLaDc3VHWFHKLrXb+ELEwLwjHX4xZr0ZxvM=","metadata":{},"hash":"sMWP4a+qew2wFi5AHQTJX2SsIExNSWdZVfM+pjvYK0U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8a57e65b-7f18-43e0-9181-f9d4c9d905a8","metadata":{},"hash":"6d3A4cYDbIN284WtsQZETutUqKmUnAgBh6U7qqO120U="}},"hash":"Vtjw8Ltje0tkEIbmfWuHLOt7McbAMBlsKsI9546itCY=","text":"Self-attention has been\r\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\r\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].

To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\r\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\r\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\r\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8]. 3    Model Architecture\r\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5,2,29]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations(x1;:::;xn)to a sequence\r\nof continuous representationsz= (z1;:::;zn). Givenz,  the decoder then generates an output\r\nsequence(y1;:::;ym)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\r\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next. The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\r\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\r\nrespectively. 3.1    Encoder and Decoder Stacks\r\nEncoder:The encoder is composed of a stack ofN= 6identical layers.

That is, the output of each sub-layer is\r\nLayerNorm(x+ Sublayer(x)), whereSublayer(x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\r\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\r\nlayers, produce outputs of dimensiondmodel= 512. Decoder:The decoder is also composed of a stack ofN= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\r\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\r\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\r\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\r\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\r\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\r\npredictions for positionican depend only on the known outputs at positions less thani. 3.2    Attention\r\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\r\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

We compute\r\nthe matrix of outputs as:\r\nAttention(Q;K;V) = softmax(QKTpd\r\nk\r\n)V(1)\r\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\r\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\r\nof1pd\r\nk\r\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\r\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\r\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\r\nmatrix multiplication code. While for small values ofdkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\r\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values ofdk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\r\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\r\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1pd\r\nk\r\n. 3.2.2    Multi-Head Attention\r\nInstead of performing a single attention function withdmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\r\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and valueshtimes with different, learned\r\nlinear projections todk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\r\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yieldingdv-dimensional\r\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\r\ndepicted in Figure 2. Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\r\nsubspaces at different positions.

This allows every\r\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\r\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\r\n[31, 2, 8]. \u000fThe encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\r\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\r\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\r\nencoder. \u000fSimilarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\r\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\r\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\r\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to\u00001) all values in the input\r\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2. 3.3    Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\r\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\r\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically.

One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\r\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required. The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\r\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\r\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\r\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\r\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare\r\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\r\ndifferent layer types. As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\r\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requiresO(n)sequential operations. In terms of\r\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\r\nlengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionalityd, which is most often the case with\r\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\r\n[31] and byte-pair [25] representations.

Doing so requires a stack ofO(n=k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\r\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [15], increasing the length of the longest paths\r\nbetween any two positions in the network.

In the former task our best\r\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles. We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\r\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\r\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\r\nsuch as images, audio and video.
